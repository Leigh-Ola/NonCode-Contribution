->The power of trust:

The first lever is trust. Advanced data analysis using responses from more than 4,500 CEOs about customer engagement and business performance shows that customer trust really does improve business outcomes. The research also suggests a three-part checklist to quickly identify improvement opportunities, and enables leaders to benchmark themselves against our surveyed CEOs.

Second, sweating the small stuff—in this case, actively managing small projects—is PwC’s shorthand description for a striking new finding: big deals get the headlines, but our analytics show that starting and stopping small projects can improve performance just as much. To realize the full potential of dynamic capital reallocation—roughly five percentage points in profitability, on average, for active reallocators—leaders should pay serious attention to the operating and decision-making norms that enable (or inhibit) nimble moves, both small and large. 

Finally, if you’re struggling to prioritize or address a proliferation of challenges in these turbulent times, management professor Richard Rumelt explains how a coherent strategy, rather than an ambitious wish list, improves your chances of success.

New PwC research shows that trust isn’t a fuzzy concept. It’s an intangible asset tightly linked with corporate performance. 

Advanced statistical analysis of data from PwC’s 25th Annual Global CEO Survey uncovers a relationship between customer trust and financial performance that’s highly significant, with influence rivaling prominently researched variables such as industry and company size. Trust accounted for 31% of the statistical model's variance for profit margins. 

Three elements of trust are most strongly connected to performance.

From analysis of the six factors comprising its customer trust index, the PwC team identified three that are most likely to influence performance. Those are CEO perceptions of their customers’ propensity to:
1. Switch to a competitor’s products or services.
2. Resist(or buy into) new updates or changes to a company’s products or services.
3. Provide feedback if the company’s products or services exceed expectations.




->The hidden power of dynamism:

Research shows that sweating the small stuff—by frequently starting and stopping projects—contributes as much to performance as big deals and enterprise-wide decisions.

Analysis of data from PwC’s 25th Annual Global CEO Survey showed that companies that redeployed resources more frequently achieved profit margins roughly five percentage points higher than companies that were less active. The PwC team looked at seven different mechanisms for resource allocation, comparing profit margins to how often they were employed; five proved to be statistically significant. 

Though this regression analysis shows only a correlation between resource reallocation and performance, the researchers have strong reason to believe there is a causal relationship between the variables.

Saying “no” creates positive returns

It is often harder to stop an initiative in an organization than to start one. This analysis suggests the right no can be valuable—hitting “stop” could free up resources for a more valuable “start”—and that leaders should advise managers to avoid letting things run on autopilot.




->The power of strategic coherence:

Your strategy may be more of a wish list than a plan.

Many business strategies are incoherent, according to business professor Richard Rumelt, reflecting the C-suite’s overreliance on tactical response even in the face of major inflection points such as market fluctuations, geopolitical instability, and disruptive trends in technology and workforce dynamics. 

Rumelt suggests that strategic coherence—a management priority championed by PwC since the 2010 publication of “The Coherence Premium” in Harvard Business Review—emerges from a quest to conquer the most important challenges facing a company: the crux. If those challenges aren’t high-stakes, then they’re not really strategic. If they contradict one another, they’re incoherent.

Consider the example of a tech company that undertook a strategic reset. First, its management team conducted a strategic review to identify its main challenges. Then, company leaders scored each challenge, from zero to ten, on its importance (how critical is it?) and its addressability (is there a good chance it could be surmounted over the next three to four years?). 

Plotting these scores quickly revealed which challenges—manufacturing problems and culture—the company needed to put at the core of its strategy.
